1. Create queue (let's say 2)
2. Set queues by burst range (first queue = low, second queue = high)
3. Separate "cars" by burst
    3a. low burst cars into first queue
    3b. high burst cars into second queue
4. Check which queue is overloaded
    4a. possible solutions:
        * set "maximum" number of elements in queue
5. Add queue if over maximum to price group
6. Alternate move "cars" from overloaded queue into the new one
7. Ensure both queues are less than maximum
8. If another "car" comes, determine which "low" or "high" queues to put in
    and put it in that queue
9.
